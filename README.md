# Tringle-Solver
 
The purpose of this C++ console application is to assist engineers in the field by solving for the missing attributes of a triangle. This program provides a practical tool for calculating the length of the third side and the measures of the other two angles based on the given information. By automating these calculations, the application saves time and helps engineers accurately determine the complete characteristics of a triangle, aiding in various engineering and mathematical applications.

## Features
- **Triangle Classification**: Determines if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene and whether it's acute, right, or obtuse.
- **Side and Angle Calculation**: Calculates missing sides or angles using various triangle formulas (SSS, SAS, ASA, SSA).
- **Perimeter and Area Calculation**: Computes the perimeter and area of the triangle using Heron's formula and trigonometric relationships.
- **User-Friendly Input**: Accepts user input in various formats and provides clear, formatted results.

## Usage
  1. Input the triangle format and measurements:
      - Enter the format (SSS, SAS, ASA, SSA) followed by the relevant measurements.
      - Example: `SSS 5 6 7`
  2. View the calculated properties:
     - The application will display the calculated angles, perimeter, area, and type of triangle.
